# isic-2019
This is my work in progress submission for the ISIC-2019 Skin lesion classification competition.

Currently it functions as a weird mix of a tutorial and my current work in progess for the competition. Many people may not be familiar with fastai library (I'm just starting to learn it) so the tutorial/walkthrough style notebooks also help me solidify my understanding of whats going on.
